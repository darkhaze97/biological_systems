1. All the types of the Entities are written in a user-intelligible way.
   i.e. we never write something like Viruss in Non_Living_Types, which is 
   an enum. However, the tables themselves can be named in user-unintelligible
   ways. E.g. Viruss as the table.
2. The convention of writing out the table names is that we add an extra
   's' in front of the table name to indicate plurality.
